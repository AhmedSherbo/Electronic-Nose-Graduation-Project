# Electronic-Nose-Graduation-Project
The term Anosmia stands for the partial or total loss of the sense of smell, and it’s a genuinedisease that affects millions of people around the globe.  Nowadays, more light has been shed onthis ailment because of the surge of the COVID-19 epidemic. This document aims to propose a newsystem that automatically senses gas leaks, smoke or early fires, spoiled and rotten foods, harmfulchemicals, and works as an Air-Quality Control System. Through the aid of an array of gas sensorsthat each distinguish a certain smell and has unique functionalities.  These sensors’ analog pins areconnected to the Raspberry-Pi pins which transmits the signals to an ADC module.  Furthermore,for processing this data, it shall pass by 2 phases, Pre-Processing phase & Feature Selection, and aProcessing Phase to finalise the Data Processing and classify Odors into Classes. The System finallynotifies the user if any disruptions or any hazardous gas spread occur via a buzzer.
